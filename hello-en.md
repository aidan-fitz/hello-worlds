Hello, world!

We are a disparate, unelected group of humans living in various parts of the world who would like to talk to members of your civilization. We do not represent the entirety of our species, nor of all life on our dear planet Earth. However, we are keenly aware of the inequality within our civilization and assure you that humanity's brightest minds are doing their best to curb it! :)

Our planet is 4.543 billion (4,543,000,000) years old; anatomically modern humans evolved within the last 100,000 years of our planet's history. 

A year, by the way, is the time it takes for us to orbit our star (the Sun) once. A day is the time Earth takes to rotate on its axis once, and a month is the time it takes for our moon to go around us once. (These definitions are approximations, however, because we use atomic clocks based on caesium-133, an atom with 55 protons and 78 neutrons. Still, they show how much inspiration our culture has taken from the stars.)

Best wishes,
